# Features:

# Project Structue.

    * I will use Bootstrap to create compoments and tie the application together.
    * I will use sqlite to store the information.
    * I will use docker to containterize the application for rapid deployment.

# Flow of the Project:

    * A user goes to the website and logs in. (optional)
        * Not to create a auth feature.
    * The user is presented with a blank todo interface (if the user is new then the interface will create a new list for the user.) If not, the user will resume preview session.
    * If optional step is not implemented them:
        * User goes to the site and interacts with the application.
        *The application has a list of task in which the can update, delete, create or read.
        *CRUD - create, read, update, delete.
